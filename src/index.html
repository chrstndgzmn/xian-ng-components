        1. When User first navigates to an angular application, the web server serves the `index.html` file. 
        
            Note: This file includes the root angular component (app-root) where the application gets loaded. This only acts as the container for the angular app. 
        
        2. The Script Bundles in 'index.html'. 
            In the build process (in this case handled by webpoack) the angular ts code is compiled and bundled into javascript files.
            These bundled js files will then get linked in the index.html (manually or vy a tool like html-webpack-plugin)
            These scripts includesall the code that will run and bootstrap the application
        
        3. Bootstrap angular
            When the browser loads index.html and executes the js bundles, the bootstrap proccess defined in main.ts is triggered
    
        4. Rendering root component
            once the bootstrapping is done, angular takes over within <app-root> all the magic happens
        
        summary:
        In short, the web server serves up index.html. 
        This file points to the JavaScript bundles generated from your Angular project. 
        When these scripts load and run in the browser, they kick off the Angular app by booting up the root module
        and component as set in main.ts. Finally, main Angular componentâ€™s view is rendered inside the root element in index.html.
